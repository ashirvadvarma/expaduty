Expa Duty

- Basically handle all of expa duty for us
- Marking people as contacted, contacting them, etc. 

Since Expa is a website, we have to use a tool that interacts with the client side code that makes expa "work" 
If we go with python3, we can use Selenium to do the web interactions for us
We could also use beautifulsoup and pyqt but would be more difficult to do 

1. Figure out what are all the things on expa we have our members do
2. Come up with a design/plan on how we can use code to do those tasks (e.g. if we need to click a box to mark someone as contacted, then our code should do that for us)
